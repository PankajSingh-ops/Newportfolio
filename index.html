            <div>
            <p>The MCA program was rigorous and challenging, but I enjoyed every moment of it. I learned programming languages like HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, as well as software development concepts like Agile methodology, software testing, and project management. I also got to work on some exciting projects that helped me hone my programming skills and gain practical experience.
                While studying for my MCA, I became interested in full-stack development. I realized that being proficient in both front-end and back-end development could open up a lot of career opportunities. I started learning web development frameworks like Angular and React and started working on some full-stack projects.
                Also I have knowledge in C, C++, Python, SQL, Oracle and Java languages knowledge.
                Apart from this, I also have 3 year experience in SEO from 2019 to 2022.

            <p>The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst of the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera. The future scope of virtual mouse is promising as technology continues to advance and new ways of interacting with digital devices are developed. Here are some potential developments in the future of virtual mouse technology: Improved accuracy and precision: Virtual mouse technology is likely to become more accurate and precise, making it a more reliable and efficient way to interact with digital devices. Integration with virtual and augmented reality: Virtual mouse technology can be integrated with virtual and augmented reality applications to provide a more immersive and natural user experience.

            <p>Voice assistants are digital assistants that use voice recognition technology to respond to user requests and commands. They are typically used to perform a variety of tasks, including: Home automation: Voice assistants can be used to control smart home devices like lights, thermostats, and security systems. Information retrieval: Users can ask voice assistants to retrieve information like the weather, news, or directions. Entertainment: Voice assistants can play music, podcasts, and audiobooks on command. Productivity: Voice assistants can set reminders, create to-do lists, and send text messages or emails. E-commerce: Users can make purchases using voice assistants. Accessibility: Voice assistants can provide assistance to people with disabilities or those who have difficulty using screens or keyboards.

    <div class="project3"><h1>Cloning Website</h1>
        <p>Cloning a website using HTML and CSS involves replicating the design and layout of an existing website using code. This process typically involves analyzing the HTML and CSS code of the original website, identifying the key design elements, and recreating them in a new HTML and CSS file. The goal of cloning a website using HTML and CSS is to create a website that looks and functions similarly to the original website. However, it's important to note that cloning a website without permission can be illegal and unethical. Cloning a website using HTML and CSS can be a useful exercise for web developers who want to improve their coding skills and learn how to replicate complex designs. It can also be a helpful way to create a prototype or template for a new website that is inspired by an existing design. Overall, while cloning a website using HTML and CSS can be a valuable learning experience, it's important to respect the intellectual property rights of the original website and only use the knowledge gained for ethical and legal purposes.</p>

    <div class="project4"><h1>Search Engine Optimisation</h1>
        <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever people search for:

            Products you sell.
            Services yoru provide.
            Information on topics in which you have deep expertise and/or experience.
            The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked on. Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to help attract website visitors who will become customers, clients or an audience that keeps coming back. SEO is a critical marketing channel. First, and foremost: organic search delivers 53% of all website traffic.

            That’s one big reason why the global SEO industry is forecast to reach a staggering $122.11 billion by 2028. SEO drives real business results for brands, businesses and organizations of all sizes.
            
            Whenever people want to go somewhere, do something, find information, research or buy a product/service – their journey typically begins with a search. </p>
